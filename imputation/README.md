# Imputation

This readme contains the description of the models used for imputation

## imputing_smaller_dataset.R

This file contains imputation procedure for smaller dataset based on the model
from Simulation3.R (3 waves, alco as behavior, tobacco1 as covar + gender)

The imputtaion works for the first wave, but not for the later waves.

No ideas.

## imputing_smaller_dataset_v2.R

This file contains imputation procedure for smaller dataset based on the model
from Simulation4.R (2 waves, also and tobacco as behavor + gender)

The imputtaion works for the first wave, but not for the later waves.

- [ ] see and try the imputation effects from my last year term paper
